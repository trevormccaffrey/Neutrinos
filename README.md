# Neutrinos
Looking for neutrino sources!

Prof Kurahashi Neilson was the first to discover that blazars can be sources of neutrinos (TXS 0506+056), but maybe all AGN can be?  Or maybe we can predict quasars that 1) have been or 2) will be blazars, and thus are likely past/future neutrino sources.  Or better yet, maybe we can identify other individual sources of neutrinos right now!  I think the following are good places to start our search.

* The [Nyland et al 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...74N/abstract) sources reported to have newly launched jets on decadal timescales (between FIRST/VLASS)
  * J0742+2704
    * RA, DEC = 115.701796, 27.070113
    * Has ~20 cataloged neutrino events within a 0.5 degree radius
    * Has one neutrino event <1arcmin from its SDSS position
    * Has one neutrino event with ~66TeV deposited in IceCube detector; TXS 0506+056 only measured ~23TeV
    * z=0.6264; broad lines from MgII through [OIII] are prominent in the [SDSS spectrum](https://dr14.sdss.org/optical/spectrum/view?id=294670)
  * (Several WISE AGNs)
